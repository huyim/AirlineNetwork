# Airline_Network

# Dataset: (not synthetic)

We are planning to use the free public dataset from OpenSky COVID-19 Flight Dataset for analysis. We extracted the data specified in these three months:  December 2019, February 2020, and April 2020. 

# Model

2.1

A node is represented by the geolocation of the airport (origin, destination). An edge/link is established between the origin and destination (airline route). 

2.2

We plan to use the Opensky data to clarify the flight patterns and flight densities around the world to investigate the connections between Covid-19 and airline network structure.

We plan to combine analysis of the variation in graph properties and the graph resilience that we learned from the key literature to draw a conclusion on the research topic.
